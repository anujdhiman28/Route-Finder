In the age of smart and intelligent systems, route optimization is crucial in logistics, navigation, and transportation. The 'Route Finder' project is designed to find and display optimal paths between cities using Artificial Intelligence search techniques. It allows users to find paths using BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms and visually renders the results using interactive maps with Folium.
